# exercise___react-api-consumption

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice advanced API consumption in a React application.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to practice:
- fetching data from APIs
- displaying API data in React components
- handling loading, error, and edge cases
- updating the UI dynamically based on API responses

This project is part of my learning process.

## What I practiced

- Using `fetch` or `axios` for asynchronous requests
- Displaying and updating dynamic data in React components
- Handling loading states, errors, and empty responses
- Organizing components for clarity and reusability
- Using React hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` for API data management
